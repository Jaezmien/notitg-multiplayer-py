Really dumb idea:
Send the CRC32 of the file, then check if it exists in Cache/index.cache of each player, then each player responds if they have that file.

This is like, really basic file checking. We're not sure if the file is 1:1 to what the server has.
Then again, this is just like, a really basic multiplayer system. The anti-cheat on this one is honestly relies on the players lmao.

Unless it gets like, highly used. In which case I would honestly move out of python on hosting the websocket.

9-2: No that sounds dumb, and forces players to use FastLoad. Create its own cache instead.

0. Check if NotITG directory exists by doing `..`'s
1. Load song tree and create crc32 hashes of the directory
